CuArrays provides a fully-functional GPU array, which can give significant speedups over normal arrays without code changes. CuArrays are implemented fully in Julia, making the implementation [elegant and extremely generic](http://mikeinnes.github.io/2017/08/24/cudanative.html).

Documentation for this package is sparse, and for many of the array operations you should
refer to the official Julia documentation. The following resources can be useful to get a
better understanding of the characteristics and performance trade offs that come with GPU
arrays:

- Introductory tutorial on [GPU programming with Julia](https://juliagpu.gitlab.io/CuArrays.jl/tutorials/intro.html)
- Slide deck on [effectively using GPUs with Julia](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1l-BuAtyKgoVYakJSijaSqaTL3friESDyTOnU2OLqGoA/)

## Installation

CuArrays should work **out-of-the-box** on Julia 1.0. You only need to have a
proper set-up of CUDA, meaning the rest of the Julia CUDA stack should work
(notably CUDAapi.jl, CUDAdrv.jl and CUDAnative.jl). If you encounter any issues
with CuArrays.jl, please make sure those other packages are working as expected.

Some parts of CuArrays.jl depend on **optional libraries**, such as
[cuDNN](https://developer.nvidia.com/cudnn). The build process should notify
about missing dependencies, i.e. inspect the output of `Pkg.build("CuArrays")`
to see whether your installation is complete.


## Features

```julia
xs = cu(rand(5, 5))
ys = cu[1, 2, 3]
xs_cpu = collect(xs)
```

Because `CuArray` is an `AbstractArray`, it doesn't have much of a learning curve; just use your favourite array ops as usual. The following are supported (on arbitrary numbers of arguments, dimensions etc):

* Conversions and `copy!` with CPU arrays
* General indexing (`xs[1:2, 5, :]`)
* `permutedims`
* Concatenation (`vcat(x, y)`, `cat(3, xs, ys, zs)`)
* `map`, fused broadcast (`zs .= xs.^2 .+ ys .* 2`)
* `fill!(xs, 0)`
* Reduction over dimensions (`reducedim(+, xs, 3)`, `sum(x -> x^2, xs, 1)` etc)
* Reduction to scalar (`reduce(*, 1, xs)`, `sum(xs)` etc)
* Various BLAS operations (matrix\*matrix, matrix\*vector)
* FFTs, using the AbstractFFTs API

We welcome issues or PRs for functionality not on this list.

Note that some operations not on this list will work, but be slow, due to Base's generic implementations. This is intentional, to enable a "make it work, then make it fast" workflow. When you're ready you can disable slow fallback methods:

```julia
julia> CuArrays.allowscalar(false)
julia> xs[5]
ERROR: getindex is disabled
```

## Tutorials

CuArrays is a great starting point for learning the fundamentals GPU
programming, because you can initially lean on the high-level
abstractions and then learn, as needed, how to obtain more
fine-grained control.  Here are some tutorials to get you started:
